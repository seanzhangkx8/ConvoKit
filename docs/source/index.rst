Cornell Conversational Analysis Toolkit (ConvoKit) Documentation
================================================================

This toolkit contains tools to extract conversational features and analyze social phenomena in conversations, using a `single unified interface <https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation/architecture.html>`_ inspired by (and compatible with) scikit-learn.
Several large `conversational datasets <https://github.com/CornellNLP/ConvoKit#datasets>`_ are included together with scripts exemplifying the use of the toolkit on these datasets.

More information can be found at our `website <https://convokit.cornell.edu>`_. The latest version is `3.3.0 <https://github.com/CornellNLP/ConvoKit/releases/tag/v3.3.0>`_ (released July 2, 2025).
