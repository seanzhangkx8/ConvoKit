* yngve_score: The maximum Yngve score of sentences in the code review comment
* frazier_score: The maximum Frazier score of sentences in the code review comment
* pdensity: The Propositional Density score of the code review comment
* cdensity: The Content Density score of the code review comment

* has_epistemic: Binary indicator of presence of a sentence with epistemic uncertainty in the code review comment
* has_conditional: Binary indicator of presence of a sentence with conditional uncertainty in the code review comment
* has_investigative: Binary indicator of presence of a sentence with investigative uncertainty in the code review comment
* has_uncertainty: Binary indicator of presence of a sentence with any uncertainty in the code review comment
* min_formality: Minimum of the formality of sentences in the code review comment
* max_formality: Maximum of the formality of sentences in the code review comment


Conversation-level information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Each conversation has the associated metadata:

* review_id: Unique identifier of a code review in the Chromium project. The URL `https://codereview.chromium.org/<review_id>` may be used to access the review online
