Perhaps one definition would be \"a number considered as large at a particular time by a particular culture\".

      "RK, I believe you are confusing ''interpretation'' with ''criticism''. I remodeled the contentious paragraph, and included a link to an article on apocalyptic literature. If I understand what you mean by \"historical\", you are regarding the book as entirely concerned with events in the recent past as of the date of authorship, fused with vague predictions of Christ coming in fire and vengeance, etc.. If so, you are not discussing an interpretation of the book qua prophecy, but an understanding held by higher critics who treat the book as an example of apocalyptic literature. Please take it there, and feel free to go crazy! Don't forget the book of Enoch, and the many apocalyptic works of the Maccabean era. .\n",

      "Hi BL, I'm curious why you re-instated the troll comment about jews ruling non-jews on the talk:Israel talk page. Going by the edits of that user on other pages, it wasn't a serious comment but something put on to deliberately provoke a reaction. Various pages linking to Israel or Jews have been targeted by a series of IPs in the 67 and 68 range, some provocatively hostile to Israel, some so sychophantically (may not be the right spelling but fuck it, I'm too knackered to care! -) ) pro-Israel they are unambiguously phoney. As you know, the Israel page and one or two others are like tinderboxes just waiting for someone to cast a match onto them. Whatever about rows over real comments, I thought it unwise to leave a crude piss-take that some people might believe was real and get angry over. We have had enough trouble on that page without phoney wind-up comments triggering off rows. -) \n",

      "Hi BL, I'm curious why you re-instated the troll comment about jews ruling non-jews on the talk:Israel talk page. Going by the edits of that user on other pages, it wasn't a serious comment but something put on to deliberately provoke a reaction. Various pages linking to Israel or Jews have been targeted by a series of IPs in the 67 and 68 range, some provocatively hostile to Israel, some so sychophantically (may not be the right spelling but fuck it, I'm too knackered to care! -) ) pro-Israel they are unambiguously phoney. As you know, the Israel page and one or two others are like tinderboxes just waiting for someone to cast a match onto them. Whatever about rows over real comments, I thought it unwise to leave a crude piss-take that some people might believe was real and get angry over. We have had enough trouble on that page without phoney wind-up comments triggering off rows. -) \n",

      "I enjoyed reading your astute comments on the privatization page. A while ago, I added content to the privatization page, specifically the theory behind it. While I agree that it's generally valid theoretically, your points are often correct in practice.\n",
      "Since it seems that you're also interested in economic policy, you might want to take a look at some content that I added a while ago to the History of post-communist Russia article. It's the best example on Wikipedia, of which I'm aware, of an in depth look at privatization in practice. Specifically, you might be interested in the sections on the three stages of privatization in Russia and the next section on the so-called \"virtual economy\" (a term coined by economists Clifford Gaddy and Barry Ickes in reference to post-Communist Russia). Since it's a long article, you'd be able to find these sections by clicking on the link in the pop up table of contents box at the top; the sections of privatization are under the broader heading of \"democratization and its setbacks.\" (Just to make a brief note about the structure of the article, the content doesn't really separate sections on economic restructuring and democratization, since they're so intertwined in a country remaking both its economic and political institutions.)\n",
      "The sections that I'm recommending bring up all the sharp insights that you made (i.e. that design is more important than the mere transfer of ownership). Here, I'll just summarize the points made in the Russia article. State monopolies were rarely restructured before privatization. Thus, there was little competition over price and quality for consumer demand. In turn, there were few incentives to invest capital to salvage inefficient value-losing enterprises. Thus, efficiency (in terms of minimizing costs per unit of output) rarely improved. Instead of channeling investment into privatized enterprises, asset stripping (facilitated by capital market liberalization) was the common result. Moreover, despite sweeping openings, capital markets (i.e. the mechanisms to channel private savings into Russian companies) remain week.\n",
      "It would be great if your interest in the articles on post-Communist Russia were aroused since I cannot find anyone interested in this subject. This is baffling since it is such a contentious topic. In academic literature (and especially within Russia), reform strategies, the sequencing of reform, and the pace of reform in post-Communist Russia remain contentious topics, argued often with great personal bitterness. After all, many prominent former Soviet specialists in the West were very active in the design of new economic and political institutions in Russia. Subject to harsh retrospective criticism, many economists at the US Treasury Department, IMF, World Bank, and top US universities have become very defensive. It's still a heated subject in the top journals, academic literature, and major periodicals on Russia and economics.\n",
      "Anyway, sorry if my comments were a bit on the lengthy side. Don't feel compelled to redirect your attention to post-Communist Russia if you're uninterested. It's only my guess that you would be from your insightful comments.  06:03, 29 Sep 2003 (UTC)\n",
      "BTW, since you are frequent contributor to Palestinian-related articles, I'm sure that the loss of the great scholar Edward Said isn't news to you. I don't know your feelings about him, but I think that his passing couldn't have come at a worse time. I'd argue that the popular writings on the Middle East in the US, exemplified by Daniel Pipes, are simply bigoted and hateful.

      "BTW, since you are frequent contributor to Palestinian-related articles, I'm sure that the loss of the great scholar Edward Said isn't news to you. I don't know your feelings about him, but I think that his passing couldn't have come at a worse time. I'd argue that the popular writings on the Middle East in the US, exemplified by Daniel Pipes, are simply bigoted and hateful. It's sad to see such an effective counterweight to their venom gone.   06:03, 29 Sep 2003 (UTC)\n",

      "Just wondering on what grounds some of these songs are termed one hit wonders... I mean I just removed \"A-Ha - Take On Me\" because A-Ha were one of the bigger acts of the 80s, with a string of top 10 hits. Kajagoogoo, while being best known for Too Shy, had two other Top 10 hits, and a further top 20 hit. Let alone the top 40.\n",
      "The Guinness Book of Hit Singles would tell us that a one hit wonder has to get to number one. I disagree with that, but would insist that a one hit wonder really has to have had only ONE HIT. Whether that's a top 40 hit or a top 75 hit is open to debate perhaps... But a LOT of these acts had more than one hit. -\n",

      " Well... the way I see it, I'd say that a seperate top 40 hit would negate a top 10 hit's OHW status. I mean, if a band gets one record in the top ten and no others in the top 40, that seems to me to work out as a OHW. But a top ten and another in the top 40 doesn't... It means we don't have to worry about a massive amount of records - just a ''lot'' of records. More than one record in the top 40 doesn't seem like a OHW to me. -\n",
