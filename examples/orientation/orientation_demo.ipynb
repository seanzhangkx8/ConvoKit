    "This notebook demos an unsupervised procedure for deriving the _orientation_ of a phrase in an utterance, a measure of the extent to which it aims forwards in a conversation to advance, relative to the extent to which it aims backwards in the conversation to address what's been said. It implements, with some methodological tweaks, an approach detailed in the [paper](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Orientation_files/orientation-forwards-backwards.pdf),\n",

    "Proceedings of ACL 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the measure, the notebook illustrates an approach to characterize utterances, and phrases within utterances, based on the types of replies that tend to come after it and the types of predecessors it's replying to. Interestingly, this approach can be seen as a generalization of the approach for inferring [Prompt Types](https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit/blob/master/examples/prompt-types/prompt-type-demo.ipynb), detailed in a [previous work](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Asking_too_much.html). We're exploring a more unified way to think about this approach, and an implementation in ConvoKit is forthcoming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the dataset used in the paper is a collection of crisis counseling conversations, which we cannot release (see [here](https://www.crisistextline.org/data-philosophy/research-fellows) for details about access). Rather, for the demo, we use a dataset of oral arguments from the Supreme Court, extracted from the Oyez [website](https://www.oyez.org/) and available [here](https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation/oyez.html) (we used a small subset of this corpus to perform some exploratory analysis that was reported in the appendix of the aforementioned paper). In this setting, we will characterize the orientation of things that the justices say in back-and-forths with lawyers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Supreme Court tends to be more lexically diverse than crisis counseling conversations; the types of cases heard are much more varied than the types of situations covered in counseling conversations, while justices often have distinctive linguistic idiosyncracies. As such, while we feel that our approach for computing orientation still returns sensible output, the demo might also suggest some additional challenges that future work could tackle, like dealing with this increased lexical diversity."
