People need those prices to come down in order to heat their homes . Why not just split those roles completely to ensure that we get an honest broker in the middle ?\n",

In the meanwhile , I content myself with the observation that I notice that all education authorities in Wales have made sufficient provision in their education funding , despite their fears and claims beforehand , to ensure that the teachers ' pay increase is paid in full in each of the eight education authorities in Wales , and that they are now turning their attention to increasing allowances for councillors .\n",

    "One thorn in our sides might be that the model occasionally gets caught up on very generic motifs e.g., `'is>*'`, and as such, will fit many questions to the type containing `'is>*'` instead of going with a better signal; various optional parameters detailed in the documentation may provide incomplete solutions to this. Another caveat is that while this model allows us to associate together lexically-diverging phrasings (e.g., \"will the Minister admit\" and \"does the Minister not realise\" both serve to be accusatory towards the Minister), we are ultimately relying on the fact that our domain has a sufficient amount of lexical regularity (e.g., the institutional norms of how people talk in parliament) -- we might need to be cleverer when dealing with noisier settings where this regularity isn't guaranteed (like social media data). \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, as a data-specific note, one of the types may be a result of the parser assuming that \"Will the learned Gentleman please answer my question?\" has \"learned\" as the root verb -- an artefact of parliamentary discourse we haven't handled. You may wish to play around with this by modifying how the data is preprocessed."

      "2008-06-09c.15.1 My hon Friend raises an extremely important point , and through the drug strategy that has just been published we are trying to recognise that if we are to treat substance misuse successfully we need not only to treat the addiction but to recognise the chaotic lifestyles that people often had prior to being imprisoned and to which they will go back when they leave . We need to tackle that problem , which means closer co - operation between the Ministry of Justice and the Home Office , and between all the other Departments that deal with benefits , housing , employment , the family and other family - related and social issues . We are working together as a Government to ensure that the offender manager for the women in question takes into account all those factors and that there is much closer co - operation between all involved to ensure that all the needs of offenders are met when they leave prison .\n",

That is partly because women , on average , have less access to personal security that they can offer to the banks , but I am afraid that it is also because some bank managers clearly do not think that women can succeed in business . We are working with the British Bankers Association on that , and through Prowess and its network of women 's business support organisations we are directly supporting loan funds that target their operations on women entrepreneurs .\n",

Of those , 80 per cent . have retained them for 13 weeks or more . My attendance at new deal taskforce meetings last year encouraged me about its progress . In my hon Friend 's constituency , long - term youth unemployment has fallen by 91 per cent . since 1997 and the claimant count for Clwyd , West is down by 44 per cent . We can all be proud of that achievement by the Labour Government .\n",

That will trigger work not just by local police forces , but by the National Crime Agency . That means that more resources will be put into investigations of this kind , which will employ all the tools that modern police are able to bring to their investigations . Rather than seeing priority being given to other issues , the hon Lady will see priority being given to this issue . Yes , police budgets have been reduced , but the percentage of police on the front line has risen , and crime has fallen all over the country .\n",

In the first quarter of 1999 there were 444 business failures—an increase of more than 40 per cent . on the equivalent period last year—and 3,000 jobs were lost in manufacturing industry alone . Business optimism has fallen faster in Wales than in any other part of the United Kingdom . Does the hon Gentleman not recognise the gravity of the situation ? Since he took office , how many times has he bothered to meet his counterparts from the Department of Trade and Industry to discuss the crippling over - regulation of small businesses , which has been gathering pace and has been exacerbated throughout his tenure of office ?\n",

      "1987-11-25a.247.0 My hon Friend makes a valid point when she says that some industries , especially the intensive energy users , are significantly affected by movements in energy prices . But , in the generality , the proposed increase will account for no more than one sixth of 1per cent . of industry 's costs , and prices for industrial consumers have fallen by more than 15 per cent . in real terms during the past five years . To answer the second part of my hon Friend 's question , I am sure that she will be as pleased as I am that the qualifying industrial consumer scheme , introduced in October 1986 , will continue to give intensive users a price reduction averaging 6 per cent .\n",

It has of course reduced in other countries too , principally in our international competitors . He suggests that the reduction in the savings ratio reflects a wider measure of wealth in the economy , but it does not . Total household assets in the UK have risen by around 50 per cent . in real terms since the beginning of 1997.The savings ratio is lower now because of the stability that we have created in the economy . Households have reduced precautionary savings because the fear of unemployment has been reduced , as has the fear of inflation .\n",

The truth is that they all charge VAT on domestic fuel and power . He is right to stress that the key issue is the price that the consumer has to pay . We are certainly accepting no lectures from the Opposition about electricity prices . Electricity prices went up by 20 per cent . every year Labour was in power and by more than a quarter in real terms . It would be nice to hear a welcome from the Opposition for the fact that in the past 10 years , since we reformed the industries , electricity prices have fallen by 8 per cent . in real terms and gas prices have fallen by 15 per cent . in real terms .

Matthew 7:16— \" By their fruits ye shall know them . \" Under the Conservatives , recorded violent crime increased by 166 per cent . , the chance of being a victim of violent crime trebled , the chance of being burgled doubled and convictions fell by a third .
