    "\n",
    "One thorn in our sides might be that the model occasionally gets caught up on very generic motifs e.g., `'is>*'`, and as such, will fit many questions to the type containing `'is>*'` instead of going with a better signal; various optional parameters detailed in the documentation may provide incomplete solutions to this. Another caveat is that while this model allows us to associate together lexically-diverging phrasings (e.g., \"will the Minister admit\" and \"does the Minister not realise\" both serve to be accusatory towards the Minister), we are ultimately relying on the fact that our domain has a sufficient amount of lexical regularity (e.g., the institutional norms of how people talk in parliament) -- we might need to be cleverer when dealing with noisier settings where this regularity isn't guaranteed (like social media data). \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, as a data-specific note, cluster 7 may be a result of the parser assuming that \"Will the learned Gentleman please answer my question?\" has \"learned\" as the root verb -- an artefact of parliamentary discourse we haven't handled. You may wish to play around with this by modifying how the data is preprocessed."
