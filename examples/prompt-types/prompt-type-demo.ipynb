I recognise the Government 's policy to encourage saving , and both the Myners and the Sandler reports contained proposals for reducing obstacles to saving and making it easier . Cash individual savings accounts have proved to be very popular , especially with low - income savers who are reluctant to part company with their savings in case of emergencies . Why , therefore , does the pre - Budget report reduce the annual ceiling on ISAs from £ 3,000 to £ 1,000 ? Is that not inconsistent with general policy ?\n",

In response to my hon Friend 's plea for full disclosure , may I say that we stand ready to assist the courts in any matter in which the courts may seek our assistance . In view of reports in one of the papers this morning , may I tell the House that at this morning 's hearing , Lord Browne - Wilkinson said that he wished to correct the suggestion in the press that the Foreign Office had refused a certificate on grounds of secrecy . He said that that was not correct at all . We will be happy to help the courts in any way that we can .\n",

I say to the hon Gentleman again that there is still time for the Labour party to make detailed proposals rather than merely throw out figures of 25 to 30 .

    "One thorn in our sides might be that the model occasionally gets caught up on very generic motifs e.g., `'is>*'`, and as such, will fit many questions to the type containing `'is>*'` instead of going with a better signal; various optional parameters detailed in the documentation may provide incomplete solutions to this. Another caveat is that while this model allows us to associate together lexically-diverging phrasings (e.g., \"will the Minister admit\" and \"does the Minister not realise\" both serve to be accusatory towards the Minister), we are ultimately relying on the fact that our domain has a sufficient amount of lexical regularity (e.g., the institutional norms of how people talk in parliament) -- we might need to be cleverer when dealing with noisier settings where this regularity isn't guaranteed (like social media data). \n",
