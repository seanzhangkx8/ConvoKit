# This example uses the wikipedia conversations corpus to reproduce figure 1
#   from the echoes of power paper (https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Echoes_of_power.html).
#
# The plots answer these questions: 
# - Do users on the whole coordinate more to admins or nonadmins?
# - Do admins coordinate to other people more than nonadmins do?
