This toolkit contains tools to extract conversational features and analyze social phenomena in conversations, using a [single unified interface](https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation/architecture.html) inspired by (and compatible with) scikit-learn.  Several large [conversational datasets](https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit#datasets) are included together with scripts exemplifying the use of the toolkit on these datasets. The latest version is [2.3.2](https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit/releases/tag/v2.3.2) (released 03 Jun 2020); follow the [project on GitHub](https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit) to keep track of updates.

Read the documentation [here](https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation).

The toolkit currently implements features for:

### [Linguistic coordination](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Echoes_of_power.html) <sub><sup>[(API)](https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation/coordination.html)</sup></sub>

A measure of linguistic influence (and relative power) between individuals or groups based on their use of function words.  
Example: [exploring the balance of power in the U.S. Supreme Court](https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit/blob/master/examples/coordination/examples.ipynb).

### [Politeness strategies](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Politeness.html) <sub><sup>[(API)](https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation/politenessStrategies.html)</sup></sub>

A set of lexical and parse-based features correlating with politeness and impoliteness.  
Example: [understanding the (mis)use of politeness strategies in conversations gone awry on Wikipedia](https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit/blob/master/examples/conversations-gone-awry/Conversations_Gone_Awry_Prediction.ipynb).

### [Prompt types](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Asking_too_much.html) <sub><sup>[(API)](https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation/promptTypes.html)</sup></sub>

An unsupervised method for grouping utterances and utterance features by their rhetorical role.
Examples: [extracting question types in the U.K. parliament](https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit/blob/master/examples/prompt-types/prompt-type-wrapper-demo.ipynb), [extended version demonstrating additional functionality](https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit/blob/master/examples/prompt-types/prompt-type-demo.ipynb), [understanding the use of conversational prompts in conversations gone awry on Wikipedia](https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit/blob/master/examples/conversations-gone-awry/Conversations_Gone_Awry_Prediction.ipynb).

Also includes functionality to extract surface motifs to represent utterances, used in the above paper [(API)](https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation/phrasingMotifs.html).

### [Hypergraph conversation representation](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Patterns_of_participant_interactions.html) <sub><sup>[(API)](https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation/hyperconvo.html)</sup></sub>
A method for extracting structural features of conversations through a hypergraph representation.  
Example: [hypergraph creation and feature extraction, visualization and interpretation on a subsample of Reddit](https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit/blob/master/examples/hyperconvo/demo_new.ipynb).

### [Linguistic diversity in conversations](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Finding_your_voice__linguistic_development.html) <sub><sup>[(API)](https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation/speakerConvoDiversity.html)</sup></sub>
A method to compute the linguistic diversity of individuals within their own conversations, and between other individuals in a population.  
Example: [speaker conversation attributes and diversity example on ChangeMyView](https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit/blob/master/examples/speaker-convo-attributes/speaker-convo-diversity-demo.ipynb)

### [CRAFT: Online forecasting of conversational outcomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01362) <sub><sup>[(API)](https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation/forecaster.html)</sup></sub>
A neural model for forecasting future outcomes of conversations (e.g., derailment into personal attacks) as they develop.  
Available as an interactive notebook: [full version (fine-tuning + inference)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SH4iMEHdoH4IovN-b9QOSK4kG4DhAwmb) or [inference-only](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GvICZN0VwZQSWw3pJaEVY-EQGoO-L5lH).

### [Orientation (coming soon)](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Orientation.html)

A method to quantify the degree to which an utterance is intended to direct the flow of the conversation forwards or backwards.

## Datasets
ConvoKit ships with several datasets ready for use "out-of-the-box".
These datasets can be downloaded using the `convokit.download()` [helper function](https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit/blob/master/convokit/util.py).  Alternatively you can access them directly [here](http://zissou.infosci.cornell.edu/convokit/datasets/).

### [Conversations Gone Awry Dataset](https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation/awry.html)

Two related corpora of conversations that derail into antisocial behavior. One corpus consists of Wikipedia talk page conversations that derail into personal attacks as labeled by crowdworkers (4,188 conversations containing 30.021 comments). The other consists of discussion threads on the subreddit ChangeMyView (CMV) that derail into rule-violating behavior as determined by the presence of a moderator intervention (6,842 conversations containing 42,964 comments).
