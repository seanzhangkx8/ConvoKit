- **Persuasion Strategies**: Logical reasoning, emotional appeals, rhetorical questions, citing authority, anecdotes, hypothetical scenarios, refuting counterarguments, shifting burden of proof, repetition, framing, social proof.
- **Interaction Dynamics**: Engagement patterns (e.g., single argument vs. back-and-forth), timing effects, persistence vs. resistance.
- **Response to Persuasion**: Agreement, concession, skepticism, counter-argument, disengagement, linguistic indicators (e.g., hedging, intensity, pronouns).
- **Trajectory of Persuasion**: Gradual shift, immediate agreement, persistent resistance, partial concession, reversal, stalemate.

- **Do not consider specific topics, claims, or arguments.
