    "For this demo, we'll use the Switchboard corpus---a collection of telephone conversations which have been annotated with various dialog acts. More information on the dataset, as it exists in ConvoKit format, can be found [here](https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation/switchboard.html); the original data is described [here](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/ws97/CL-dialog.pdf).\n",

Since Switchboard consists of transcribed telephone conversations, there are many disfluencies and backchannels, that make utterances messier, and that make it hard to identify what counts as an actual turn. In the version of the corpus we consider, for the purpose of demonstration, we remove the disfluencies and backchannels (acknowledging that we're discarding important parts of the conversations). "
