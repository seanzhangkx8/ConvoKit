    "# Applying the Expected Context Framework to Parliamentary Question Periods\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates an application of the Expected Context Framework to analyze question periods in the British House of Commons. We will principally use the framework to derive a typology of questions based on their rhetorical role; later in the notebook, we'll explore some other properties that the framework derives. \n",
    "\n",
    "An earlier version of the method is implemented via the `PromptTypes` module in ConvoKit, and is demoed [here](https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit/blob/master/examples/prompt-types/prompt-type-demo.ipynb). That version, and more details on the dataset, are found in [this paper](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Asking_too_much.html). Details about the Expected Context Framework, and the extended analyses presented below, can be found in [this dissertation](https://tisjune.github.io/research/dissertation)."

We consider it important for him to receive advice from as wide a range of sources as possible . Will he therefore explain why two gentlemen , Mr. John Allen and Colonel Geoffrey Inkin , have between them been vice chairmen of the Land Authority , chairman of the Land Authority , chairman of the Housing for Wales , chairman of Cwmbran development corporation , chairman of Cardiff Bay development corporation , and ex - vice chairman of Cwmbran district council ? Why does the Minister not obtain advice from all over Wales , rather than adopt such an incestuous relationship with failed Tory party candidates and Tory placemen ?\n",

Has he presented to the Treasury the British Council 's claim for an extension of activities to Indonesia and China ? Why is his Department so publicly supportive of the British Council but will not fight for it in private ?\n",
      "> 1996-05-09a.351.4 0.400 When the Minister meets the president of the NFU , will he explain to him why the Government are seeking to deny the House of Commons the opportunity to express its views on a proper motion in the agriculture debate next week ? That debate will be of great importance to the dairy sector during the BSE crisis—the biggest crisis to hit our agriculture this century . Why is the Minister ignoring the recommendation of the Select Committee on European Legislation that there should be an early debate in the House rather than in European Standing Committee A ? What is he afraid of ?\n",
      "> 1984-04-05a.1102.4 0.401 How many letters drew attention to the fact that this Budget gives most to the people who already have most and does nothing for the people who have least ? When Ministers reply to the letters do they explain this as being inevitable , accidental or a direct result of Government decision ?\n",

The last Secretary of State for Defence said that the Helmand venture would end in three years without a shot being fired . What we are now seeing in the formerly peaceful area of Helmand is bitter resentment , not among the Taliban but among the ordinary people : murderous resentment of our troops . If we are sucked into a war in Afghanistan , it could deteriorate into a British Vietnam and provoke Afghan terrorism on the streets of Britain . When will we explain to our American friends and to our Government that it is not possible to win hearts and minds by using bombs and bullets ?\n",

Why , then , is it almost impossible today to find a single independent forecaster who agrees with them ?

The idea that that will not impact on front - line policing is one for the fairies . Can the Minister explain why the 20 % cut announced in direct Government funding for police forces is front - loaded ? In other words , of that 20 % , why are the deepest , most far - reaching cuts in the first two years - next year 6 % , in 2012 - 13 8 % , then 4 % and 4 % ?

      ">> 1989-05-08a.541.2 0.535 Of course . That is one of the reasons why the review was confined to England . As the hon Gentleman said , a five - year development strategy has been evolved by the Wales tourist board , and it is expected that it will trigger off about £ 73 million of private sector money and create 2,000 jobs . Therefore , there is every reason for us to continue as we are .\n",
      ">> 1988-07-25a.4.2 0.542 We clearly can not appoint a Regulator until the necessary legislation has passed through Parliament . Until the Regulator is appointed and the regulatory regime is in place , the Government will oversee , or , to use my hon Friend 's word , \" monitor \" , the electricity supply industry 's preparation for privatisation . In particular , we shall oversee the negotiations of the initial contracts between distribution boards and the CEGB 's successors . We shall not permit practices designed to stifle competition or to prevent distributors from making contracts with new sources of supply .\n",
      ">> 1997-11-03a.10.3 0.547 In the great history of brass necks in politics , I suppose that the hon Gentleman does not shine out , but savings in this year 's defence budget will have to be made to fill the holes in capability that his hon Friends left . In addition to that , we inherited a 3 per cent . efficiency savings target from the previous Government . The hon Gentleman was a special adviser to the previous Administration , so he knows a little about random , ad hoc , arbitrary cutting of defence budgets . Perhaps he should apologise to the House rather than boast .\n",
      ">> 1991-02-04a.9.0 0.552 With respect to my hon Friend , if further loans are made to somebody they are not expected to repay the second loan until the first has been completed . Of course , there is no question of interest being charged on any of the loans—they are all interest - free .\n",
      ">> 1999-07-12a.14.3 0.559 I have to point out that the Opposition supported the principles behind the Good Friday agreement , and it is , frankly , wrong for the hon Gentleman to condense both that issue and hunting . I am sure that he , like the rest of us , wants to see peace in Northern Ireland , and I should not have expected the hon Gentleman to raise this issue along with that of Northern Ireland .\n",
      ">> 1992-02-13a.1102.5 0.563 My hon Friend is right about the revenues from North sea oil taxation . This financial year , they are expected to be just over £ 1 billion—about one half of 1 per cent . of total tax revenues .\n",
      ">> 1991-05-08a.707.0 0.574 We got rid of the unfair principle underlying the old rating system , to which the hon Gentleman wants to return , whereby the occupants of more expensive properties—even if they had modest incomes—were expected to pay limitless sums towards local government . The hon Gentleman also wants sole occupants to pay as much as multiple - occupancy households . That was a major unfairness under the rates system , and we are not prepared to return to it . The hon Gentleman has been barking up the wrong tree for some time . We devised a system that appeals to the British public as being fair , because it dispenses with the extremes of the rating system . We prefer to base a system on 1991 values , whereas the hon Gentleman wants to use 1973 values .\n",

I am surprised that the hon Gentleman did not welcome the fact that we have created 2.6 million extra jobs , and that levels of employment are the highest seen in the economy for many years . I would have expected him to at least acknowledge the Government 's success in terms of employment .\n",
      ">> 1982-04-07a.938.2 0.583 I must deny the hon Gentleman 's statement . Last year 's claim was £ 644 million . At 1982 prices , that amounts to £ 704 million . This year 's grant is £ 804 million . Therefore , that is £ 100 million more than was originally claimed last year .\n",

      "> 1999-07-13a.157.1 0.373 Could the Minister give an assurance that he will pay particular attention in his review to applications for sites within areas of outstanding natural beauty , including the Chiltern hills ? Will he take careful account of the reports that pressure is being exerted to overturn the decision of the local planning authority on Chisleys wood in my constituency ? That pressure is coming from Government Departments and the current tenant of Chequers . Will he ensure that he takes all steps within his Department to avoid any conflict of interest in determining the outcome ?\n",
      "> 2010-01-19c.159.8 0.377 I welcome the Secretary of State 's comments on Haiti , but may I ask whether we are using all our assets ? The Type 23 frigate , HMS Iron Duke , is in the Caribbean but not being utilised . Our military stabilisation and security teams , which performed so admirably after the Indonesian earthquake , remain to be dispatched to Haiti . Will he consider those assets ?\n",
      "> 2009-07-02c.466.1 0.386 What a pleasure it is to see you in the Chair , Mr. Speaker . May I ask my right hon Friend the Secretary of State to pass on my welcome to my two colleagues who have joined him on the Front Bench ? Food and food production are far too important to be left entirely to the advocacy of Members with rural constituencies . They are of importance to everyone . I noted my right hon Friend 's response to the hon Member for Lancaster and Wyre ( Mr. Wallace ) . Will he consider approaching the Office of Fair Trading and pressing it for its view on what is competitive in the dairy market ? That would allow it to take a more pragmatic approach when mergers and changes happen in the co - operative sector .\n",
      "> 2001-06-26.502.0 0.387 I am disappointed that it is not the Secretary of State at the Dispatch Box . Labour 's NHS plan states that the Government are in favour of a new pay system for the NHS , and figures published today detail the pay received by the service 's humble and self - effacing nurses . They show that general nurses get about two thirds of what is paid for agency work , while a theatre - registered general nurse gets paid about half the rate for an agency job . Is it the Government 's plan to bring the pay of people who work for the national health service up to the levels available outside , so that they will not leave the service and work elsewhere ? If so , will he ensure that all those working for the NHS come within the pay review body structure ? Above all , will he ensure that ambulance personnel receive the sort of pay that people who save lives every day deserve ?\n",
      "> 2000-11-30a.1123.5 0.387 I welcome Lord Sainsbury 's report , but what steps will the Government take specifically to assist industrial biotechnology ? Bearing in mind the work that my right hon Friend the Secretary of State has been doing along with others in the north - west , will my hon Friend consider carefully the fantastic successes in industrial biotechnology in the north west and urge the Government to inject more support into the projects going to our academic institutions there , thus helping our industrial partners ?\n",
      "> 2014-06-12c.677.0 0.389 I am grateful to the Secretary of State for that reply . Will he ensure that , in addition to that scientific examination , he also meets with the Welsh Assembly Minister who is dealing with this matter in Wales—not too far from his own constituency—where an alternative method of vaccination is being undertaken ? Will the Secretary of State agree to evaluate that as part of the process as well ?\n",
      "> 2009-07-01b.286.6 0.390 May I press the new Minister for a better answer to the question put by my hon Friend the Member for Salisbury ( Robert Key ) ? Church groups , scout groups and sports clubs face crippling hikes in their water bills as a result of the proposed changes . Three months ago , I asked the previous Minister whether he would consider a moratorium , at least until an impact assessment was carried out . He said that he would speak to colleagues across Government , but we have heard nothing and time is running out . In welcoming the members of the new team , may I ask them what their view is ? Will they consider a moratorium or the idea of a special social tariff , or will they continue the policy of doing nothing ?\n",
      "> 1979-06-26a.262.6 0.395 Will the hon Lady agree that the changes to be made in pensions will only allow prospectively for the miscalculation , and not for the miscalculation in the current year ? Is she aware that in the current year pensioners are losing out by the amount that I quoted in my question ? Will she take the opportunity of the Bill dealing with the Christmas bonus to introduce a summer bonus as well to make good that shortfall ?\n",
      "> 2001-06-26.501.1 0.397 The strength of primary care trusts lies in the way they can respond to and meet local needs . When my right hon Friend considers delegation , will he ensure that the allocation of money to the trusts is speeded up ? Also , in the modernisation process that is taking place in the national health service , will he ensure that we do not end up with larger primary care trusts than those that have just been set up ? The trust in my constituency is doing a splendid job and I want it to continue to do so .\n",
      "> 2007-07-11b.1458.1 0.397 I warmly welcome the Prime Minister 's statement , which contrasted with the churlish Punch - and - Judy effort from the Leader of the Opposition . I suspect that parliamentarians throughout the House will welcome my right hon Friend 's comments today . Will he examine the relationship between Parliament and the Executive ? Government and Parliament are stronger in partnership than when one dominates the other . In that context , will he ensure that all Bills are introduced in draft , so that the House can discuss them properly ? Will he also ensure the fullest pre - legislative scrutiny ? If we have that , we will end up with better law and better government .\n",

I welcome the changes in inheritance tax because the industry obviously needs them , but does the Minister agree that over a range of agricultural changes introduced as a result of the common agricultural policy , it will be necessary to avoid preventing the achievement of major environmental access and recreational agreements ? The good work that the Minister has done in the past could be undone . Does the Minister agree that some steps will have to be taken to mitigate those effects ?\n",

Given that on the bathing water directive alone , the Government intend that £ 760 million worth of work will be done after 1993 , does he agree that if the Commission insists on 1993 as the date , there will be a big shock for those people who are making short - term gains from the water privatisation ?\n",

I agree that we need to see progress in the Doha development round . We expect to see revised negotiating drafts of documents , which could potentially lead to ministerial discussions to close the round towards the end of January , or perhaps at the beginning of February .

      ">> 2012-07-03c.758.2 0.314 I congratulate my hon Friend ’s constituent on his birthday yesterday . The argument for retaining a retirement age of 70 for judges of all kinds—I agree that this is a mere stripling for most occupations—is that , unlike me and most other people in their 70s , they can not be removed from office : they are there for life , and can be removed only for quite serious bad behaviour . If we let everybody go on until whatever age , we will get into difficulties and politicians or somebody else will have to start appraising their performance , as they can not be dismissed peremptorily . That is what has made us hold back from raising the compulsory retirement age for magistrates and judges at every level .\n",
      ">> 2008-12-11b.660.1 0.314 My hon Friend is an expert in these areas , and I agree that the integrated nature of the automotive supply chain brings real challenges for suppliers when the automotive manufacturers decide to take extended breaks . We are acutely aware of the pressures that the situation is causing a number of supply chain companies . As he is aware , the UK has about 200,000 jobs in the supply chain alone , about 500,000 in retail and about 180,000 in direct automotive production . This is a vast and important sector of the UK economy , and we need to examine what more we can do to support companies that are going through very difficult times at the moment .\n",
      ">> 1992-10-19a.203.2 0.320 I agree ; but it is extremely important , in a subject about which people hold strong , sincere and deep views , that we get the question of reforming the divorce law right rather than simply achieve speed . It is inevitable that , during the discussions , there will be a great deal of deliberation about mediation , particularly if we are to depart from the traditional adversarial role in divorce matters and from the concept of fault and blame .\n",
      ">> 2016-01-27d.263.0 0.321 I absolutely agree with my hon Friend . Of course , we hold our service personnel to the highest standards , and it is right that we do , but it is quite clear that there is now an industry trying to profit from spurious claims that are lodged against our brave servicemen and women . I am determined to do everything we can to close that bogus industry down . We should start by making it clear that we will take action against any legal firm that we find to have abused the system to pursue fabricated claims . That is absolutely not acceptable .\n",
      ">> 2007-06-06b.252.5 0.322 Of course , local decision making is important , but I hope that the hon Gentleman agrees that if we are to deal with housing issues , we have to expand the availability of housing because of the expansion in the number of households . I agree that a balance needs to be struck , but that must include proposals that allow us to make sure that our people , particularly our younger people , have houses to buy .\n",
      ">> 1996-12-04a.1033.2 0.322 I agree with the statistics that my hon Friend mentioned . He is right to emphasise the importance of promoting the multilateral free trade agenda . Free trading blocs can have their place , so long as they are not exclusive and do not confine their benefits to their members . We want the free trade agenda to be spread widely . If a bloc such as my hon Friend describes contributes to that , it can form an acceptable part of the multilateral agenda . But the globalisation of trade liberalisation is our main objective .\n",

The United Kingdom 's anti - corruption legislation is among the most comprehensive in the world and we are working within the Organisation for Economic Co - operation and Development and the European Union to ensure that our major overseas competitors enact similar legislation .

Those include engaging with foreign Governments to ensure that common challenges are identified , and encouraging them to work with us to address those challenges . We have asked each of our posts to identify a single point of contact on human trafficking , and we are working in consultation with colleagues across government and with non - governmental organisations to bring together all the work that is already going on , including on the specific local challenges in each country .

However , in this case NHS England decided that if it was to follow precisely the ACRA recommendations , it would lead to higher growth for areas with better health outcomes and lower growth , or even cuts , for areas with less good outcomes , which it thought would be inconsistent with its responsibility to reduce health inequalities . That is why it is conducting a fundamental review , which it says it hopes will inform the next set of allocations for 2013 - 14 .\n",
      ">> 1996-12-09a.14.1 0.544 The aid to South Africa and to other southern African countries is certainly not mutually exclusive . As my hon Friend knows from our conversations—I am aware of his interest in the subject—we give substantial bilateral aid to Africa . Indeed , three quarters of all bilateral aid goes to the poorest countries . Therefore , we are very well aware of the points that he has raised .\n",

I am satisfied that the Coal Board is doing everything that it can to minimise the nuisance . Work is progressing as quickly as possible to clear the bing as effectively as possible . I am aware that it is important to keep residents informed , and therefore I was pleased to hear from the area director this morning that he is making arrangements for a public meeting to be held as soon as possible , when experts will be in attendance to answer detailed questions .\n",

I can also assure him that we , as a party , will publish a draft Bill later next year . Whether the coalition and this Parliament will choose to accept such a Bill , or whether it needs to wait for a majority Conservative Government , is something I suspect we will discover then .\n",

However , I am sorry to say that it would be inappropriate for me to comment at this stage , when the Competition Commission has published only its preliminary findings and when there is an opportunity for those who participated in the inquiry to comment on their initial findings . I understand that the commission will report early in the new year , and when it has done so Ministers will give an appropriate response if recommendations are made to the Government .\n",

Following the collapse of Farepak , more that 100 credit unions throughout the country now offer Christmas savings accounts , which is to be welcomed .

My figures on the fall in manufacturing output under the last Labour Government are correct and I will send the right hon Lady those figures so that she does not make the same mistake twice . [ Interruption . ] If she will be quiet for a minute and let me get a word in edgeways , I can tell her that investment has risen six times faster under this Government than under Labour .

I must tell the House , in case it escaped the hon Gentleman 's notice , that I do not have ministerial responsibility for Mr. Campbell , so I am not in a position to deal with that matter . As for the hon Gentleman 's final observation , I was slightly surprised by his suggestion that he would prefer a judicial inquiry to one conducted by right hon and hon Members in the House of Commons .

It is hard to know where the Opposition expect to get such money , as they have already mortgaged the future with promises to spend on almost everything else .

I can give the House that promise . On the rest of the hon Gentleman 's question , we can not govern by hint .

The problems of poverty and social exclusion across Wales and the huge gap between the rich and the poor were evident to everybody . It is important that we continue this Government 's commitment to investing in education and overcoming the problems of child poverty .

I remind him that , under the first programme for the valleys , 2,600 acres throughout the valleys of south Wales have been cleared—a record which can compare with the best in Europe .\n",

    "One interesting thing to point out is that among questions asked by government affiliated members, aggressive (e.g., **demand for account**) questions tend to be asked more by older askers (indicated by blue dots) -- that is, it seems that as parliamentarians get more tenured, they ask more aggressive questions. Note that the ministers answering these questions are almost always affiliated with the government, so this means that older askers are more aggressive, even towards members of their own party. In [this dissertation](https://tisjune.github.io/research/dissertation) we more carefully examine this observation."

One has only to look at the production of Nissan cars in a green field site to see that if the product is competitive and meets a demand , it will immediately take a piece of the market .\n",

That has made a real difference to the outcomes for cancer patients .

That is important . Many people have been critical of investment in sports facilities that have not been available to the wider community . There is a change in culture and attitude among many in education—those who must ensure that those centres of excellence can be used by the whole community .

A decision was taken at the time , which was endorsed by this Government as well , but I understand the very strong feelings that there are , not least among the families of the pilots .

Is not one reason for that , as Jacques Delors said , that Britain has become a paradise for overseas investment and is not that because the Government have tackled the excessive power of the trade unions and refused to sign the job - destroying social chapter ? Is not that in stark contrast with the union - dominated Labour party , which seems to believe that only the state can generate economic growth—a view which not even the Russians believe nowadays ?\n",

      "> 1992-02-05a.280.6 0.071 I entirely agree with my hon Friend . The House will know that 46 British inspectors have been involved in the process of inspection within Iraq . Certainly I pay tribute to them and to their colleagues from other countries . On the second part of my hon Friend 's question , yes , it is important to enhance the verification and inspection powers of IAEA. I hope that we shall succeed in doing that , especially with regard to special inspections of previously undeclared sites .\n",
      "> 1990-12-11a.802.0 0.078 The hon Gentleman is absolutely right and I welcome his support . His party is not renowned for its determination to stand up to proposals emanating from the European Commission . I hope that we can derive some confidence from his words that the Liberal Democrats will agree with our efforts , supported by the CBI and other organisations , to resist those extremely damaging proposals .\n",
      "> 2005-12-05b.599.0 0.078 I entirely agree with my hon Friend and I congratulate those who have been doing that work in his area . Where work has been done through the alcohol misuse enforcement campaign to clamp down on alcohol - related crime , the result has been a significant reduction in such crime . However , he is right to say that there should be no tolerance of organisations that repeatedly sell to under - age drinkers . I support the full use of the powers that we have given police forces and others to clamp down on the sort of morally unacceptable behaviour to which he has drawn our attention .\n",
      "> 2013-02-25b.14.6 0.080 I agree with my hon Friend that that is extremely important . I believe that we will do what he asks , and if we do not , I am sure he will bring it to our attention . Since I first went to the Ministry of Defence nearly three years ago , he has been a doughty exponent of the need for the development of commercial and residential estates on old MOD sites . I pay tribute to him for his work on behalf of his constituents .\n",
      "> 2008-02-05b.773.1 0.084 On the first point , my hon Friend is right about some sluggishness in PCTs in commissioning these services . That is why we have made it a tier 2 issue in the operating framework this year and increased funding by 11 per cent . On the second point , I pay tribute to the work that she too has done on fluoridation over the years . I entirely agree , as do the British Medical Association , the British Dental Association and every reputable scientist who has considered it , that extending fluoridation is the best way to close health inequalities .\n",
      "> 2009-12-16b.959.5 0.088 I congratulate the Daily Record on its campaign against loan - sharking . It is important that we inform everybody that Government - funded money advice centres are there to help people , that in all areas there are loan - sharking investigation teams and that people can look to their credit unions for help . For many families , there is a lot of pressure at Christmas , so they should take advice and use credit unions .\n",
      "> 1998-06-15a.15.6 0.088 My hon Friend is right . However , as we saw when I visited his constituency , the process can not be easy or immediate . There needs to be a commitment on the part of police and local authorities ; they need to win the support of the local community , and they need to listen to members of that community , who best know the type of crime that spoils their lives . A commitment to such a partnership , and to cutting crime , is essential , and I congratulate my hon Friend on the way in which he is encouraging that in his constituency .\n",
      "> 2004-03-09.1367.1 0.088 Yes , I do . There are opportunities for all kinds of imaginative ways of running the railways better . Often , local circumstances dictate how best the railway should be run in that area , and a great deal can be done to tap the creative potential that is there to provide better service for customers .\n",
      "> 2012-01-25a.286.2 0.089 Yes , I most certainly do—2012 is the year to visit Northern Ireland , with the launch of “ Your Time , Our Place ” last week , before returning in 2013 for the UK city of culture . I pay tribute to my hon Friend for his sterling work in encouraging Members to donate to his window to commemorate Her Majesty ’s diamond jubilee . I did a quick ring - round of the Northern Ireland Office , and I am glad to say that I have donated—although I have not told my wife—the Secretary of State has donated and our Minister in the Lords has donated .\n",
      "> 2012-09-12a.263.9 0.089 I pay tribute to the hundreds of skilled workers in the hon Gentleman ’s constituency who contribute so much to United Kingdom and , indeed , international defence through the work that they do at Raytheon and elsewhere , and I agree that this is not the time to be putting that at risk . On the specifics of the Type 26 , it is clear that if Scotland were an independent country , the rest of the UK would be applying European Union procurement rules , which basically keep such contracts for the domestic market . We would therefore be locking ourselves out of the potential for millions of pounds - worth of work involving hundreds of jobs in Scotland , and that is not acceptable .\n",

However , did my hon Friend detect in the smearing attack on Christianity by the hon Member for Bath ( Mr. Foster ) the idea that multiculturalism means that the Judaeo - Christian tradition of this country is no more or less valid than any other tradition ? Is that not something that she and I should reject completely ?\n",
      ">> 1999-07-12a.17.2 0.166 I agree with what has been said about the excellent work of the specials and the depth of their interest and commitment . However , does my hon Friend agree that the fundamental problem in becoming a special is the need to take time off work , and that there is a need to mount a proper campaign—perhaps alongside the Territorial Army and school governors—to persuade employers of the value of that activity ? That would encourage people to put themselves forward for that interesting and rewarding activity .\n",
      ">> 1985-06-10a.633.9 0.174 I welcome the increase in the number of circuit judges . However , does the Attorney - General agree that there are still intolerable delays in the trials of serious cases in the Crown courts ? Is there not still a considerable need for the appointment of more circuit judges ? Does he also agree that it is the judges who carry much of the responsibility for speeding up the terrible delays which sometimes occur in the police force and in the DPP 's Department over the processing of cases quickly for trial ?\n",

However , does he agree with his hon Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet ( Mr. Chapman ) that the number is still tiny in relation to the size of the Civil Service ? What is the impediment ? Is it that there is such disparity in the terms and conditions of service that it is difficult to switch individuals backwards and forwards ?\n",
      ">> 1998-05-18a.596.4 0.179 I am certainly in favour of using the Select Committee system in the most effective way possible . However , does the right hon Lady not agree that , in her Government 's increasingly farcical handling of the arms to Sierra Leone affair , it was hardly a contribution to the effectiveness of Select Committees that , last week , during Business Questions , she should have referred to correspondence directed to the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee that the House had not seen , but which—I need hardly add with this Government—the BBC had ?\n",
      ">> 1993-07-05a.17.1 0.186 Does my hon Friend agree that the significant increase in judicial appointments in recent years from ladies and members of ethnic minority communities is greatly to be welcomed ? However , does he agree also that it is ludicrous for the Labour party to call for some kind of positive discrimination when what the British people need are the best judges ? Is not it absolutely right for the Lord Chancellor to continue to insist that judges will be appointed only on merit and does not the positive discrimination suggested by the Labour party lead Labour into the ridicule and contempt of the British people ?\n",
      ">> 1997-02-10a.1.8 0.189 Is it not a good idea for cyclists to make use of the railway ? I understand that the Secretary of State has an honourable record on this in connection with work that he produced when he was a Back Bencher , which involved my hon Friend the Member for Newham , South ( Mr. Spearing ) . However , has not a new situation arisen with the railways ' fragmentation ? It has presented many blocks and problems , so that information to cyclists about moving throughout the system is difficult to obtain . Pre - booking is beginning to be required . There is the costs problem and there is no official monitoring of cyclists ' problems . Perhaps it is time for the Secretary of State to get on his bike and sort those things out .\n",
      ">> 1995-06-13a.589.1 0.191 Does the Minister agree that any form of discrimination , especially age , is unacceptable ? However , is there not a danger that the slogan \" Too Old , Who Says ? \" could be undermined by Lady Thatcher 's latest efforts to undermine this discredited and dying Government ?\n",
      ">> 2001-01-23a.783.4 0.193 It may not be strictly necessary to mention this , but I have a registerable interest in relation to such matters , which is recorded in the Register of Members ' Interests . The Secretary of State will , of course , have the support of all hon Members for the efforts that are being made to cause the talks to be successful , and he is right to applaud the efforts of President Clinton . However , does he agree that unless there is recognition of the right of return , as contained in United Nations Security Council resolution 194 , then the prospects for a lasting peace will be severely diminished ? Is it not time that the old people who hold in their hands the crumbling deeds of their houses and the receipts that they paid for property tax , should have a hope of returning to the homes from which they were driven or expelled all those years ago ?\n",
      ">> 2001-03-13a.812.2 0.193 I welcome the objective of treating more people in their own homes . However , is the Minister not alarmed that social services budgets throughout the country are expected to finish the financial year more than £ 200 million overspent ? Although he has announced rises in the standard spending assessment for next year , social services directors expect next year to be even tougher . What hope is there that the services the Government talk about can be provided for people in their own homes , if social services departments struggle to meet even their existing commitments out of their existing resources ?\n",

I recall that at the meetings we had the farmers asked that , whatever conclusions we came to , we would give them the opportunity of expressing support for the possibility of a producer - financed eradication scheme . We are considering the details of that at the present time . The number of outbreaks this year is very similar to the number in the year before . There is no indication of the type of flare - up of the disease that had been feared in some quarters . I should like to eradicate every disease , but there is a priority in terms of public expenditure as to what we can eradicate . If producers are willing to finance an eradication scheme , obviously I must consider the proposal .\n",

      "> 2005-06-23a.944.5 0.078 I thank my hon Friend for his kind comments , and I agree with what he says . The Women and Work Commission was set up because achieving equal pay for women remained a problem even many years after the Equal Pay Act 1970 was introduced . The gender pay gap has narrowed significantly but it remains wide , especially in respect of part - time working . This is a complex issue : occupational segregation is one element , but there are many others . I assure my hon Friend that the commission is fully involved with trade unions and the EOC , and with the representatives of many businesses and employers .\n",
      "> 2000-01-12a.270.1 0.079 That is precisely why we shall not implement them . If I might expand on the remarks of my hon Friend , there were reports in The New York Times , during the past two days— [ Interruption . ] I was going to read them out in response to further questions from the Leader of the Opposition , but I never got any . In The New York Times , for example , it was reported that the wave of flu has become widespread , overwhelming emergency rooms , filling hospital beds , and forcing postponement of operations . In many overcrowded rooms , people are simply leaving without being treated . In Ireland , hospitals in Dublin and around the country were forced again to cancel almost all routine surgery and procedures . In Sweden , all the intensive care facilities are full ; some non - urgent operations have been cancelled and closed - down wards are having to be reopened . Elsewhere—in Italy , Norway , Germany , France and Switzerland—there are huge problems as a result of the flu outbreak . Having s\n",
      "> 2001-03-05a.6.1 0.081 I have no wish to be churlish , especially as I read last week of some extremely complimentary remarks that the right hon Gentleman made about the Government 's stakeholder pensions . I am grateful to him for having recognised how valuable a contribution they will make . On the question of fraud , I understand why the right hon Gentleman seeks to clear his name , but he will know that it was not until 1995 that any serious attempt was made to measure fraud and error in the system . It is true , as I said , that in 1997 some efforts were made to deal with the problem ; however , they focused almost entirely on simply detecting fraud that had already entered the system . The National Audit Office recognised the shortcomings of that as the sole strategy , because it almost encouraged people to let in fraud by rewarding them for detecting it . We have stopped fraud entering the system in the first place . As I have told Opposition Members who have asked the question , the fraud and error r\n",
      "> 1994-05-05a.830.8 0.082 The hon Gentleman is well aware of the great concern , energy and effort that the Ministry puts into the matter . I am happy to give him the assurances that he seeks . Furthermore , the regime that we have applied includes extensive checks other than those that are statutorily required . We will continue to maintain our high animal health status , which is a very high priority for the Department . I should be happy if the hon Gentleman would be good enough to send me whatever evidence he has so that we can pursue the matter .\n",
      "> 2008-07-22c.652.1 0.084 My hon Friend raises a very important point . In fact , he must have raised it in his constituency , as the rates of MRSA and C. difficile infection in the Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust were in decline in March this year . All health staff in the area are to be congratulated . We have reduced infection rates significantly for MRSA and C. difficile . Latest data from the Health Protection Agency for January to March show that MRSA bloodstream infections are down 33 per cent . from the same quarter of last year , and by more than 49 per cent . from the 2003 - 04 monthly average . The same is true for C. difficile infections : in the most vulnerable group of those aged 65 and over , the rate is 32 per cent . lower than in the same quarter of last year . NHS staff work extremely hard to drive down the number of infections . I agree that we must not take our eye off the ball , but we must also recognise such significant improvements .\n",
      "> 1994-03-14a.601.11 0.084 The hon Gentleman will be aware that that is a matter for my right hon Friend the Secretary of State for Transport . I can assure the hon Gentleman that my right hon Friend and I will ensure that that matter is given every consideration .\n",
      "> 2006-04-27b.694.6 0.085 No , I do not . We are on a journey with extended schools . As I said , more than 6,000 schools are working with us directly to provide extended services . The baseline survey that we conducted at the outset showed that approximately 95 per cent . of secondary schools and 87 per cent . of primary schools already offered extended activities after school to some extent . There is therefore a great deal of interest and commitment . Extended activities help schools to maximise the attainment of their children and support parents in doing that . Schools that have provided extended activities for some time are convinced of the benefits . I am sure that , as we develop the programme , that will be the case for all schools . The money provided—£840 million so far—is for start - up costs . Schools need to ensure that they sustain activities and we will support them with a charging regime to ensure that they do .\n",
      "> 2004-03-18.445.6 0.086 The hon Gentleman raises several important points . I can assure him that two safeguards are in place as regards any change to trial systems . Such proposals would , first , have to come before this House for its approval following debate and discussion ; and , secondly , they would have to be compliant with our international obligations under the European convention on human rights as enshrined in the Human Rights Act 1998 . As for whether closer work between the Crown Prosecution Service and the police could contaminate the independence of the CPS , the answer is emphatically no . It is a good idea for the police to have early advice on the nature of the charge and what evidence would be admissible . That does not impede the independence of the Crown Prosecution Service , but it will ensure that the police are able effectively to progress the investigation and that the trial works properly .\n",
      "> 2008-05-12c.1045.0 0.087 I am grateful to my hon Friend , my right hon Friend the Member for Makerfield ( Mr. McCartney ) and the Secretary of State for their involvement in relation to the jobs in Wigan . Clearly , we want to make sure that we protect as many jobs as possible , and that will be a consideration when we look at the various options . I will be happy to meet my hon Friend the Member for Wigan ( Mr. Turner ) and my right hon Friend the Member for Makerfield to make sure that we go through every opportunity . There is great interest in the House about the sale of the Tote ; the issue has been with us for some time . We need to make sure that we get the best possible return . I should like to put on the record my tribute to the work force in Wigan and to the Tote 's management , who have been keeping going under difficult circumstances .\n",
      "> 1990-06-13a.279.8 0.087 I am aware of the suggestions for a parliamentary delegation . That could help . Those who are concerned , including my hon Friend , are in touch with the Foreign Office about it .\n",

      ">> 1999-03-24a.383.0 0.217 Does the Minister recognise that , although we welcome the measures that have been taken to combat ordinary crime in Northern Ireland , the main concern of the people of Northern Ireland is still the large hoard of illegal weapons held by terrorist organisations ? Does the Minister therefore recall that the hon Member for Foyle ( Mr. Hume ) has consistently said that terrorist hoards of weapons should be given up ? Does he welcome the statement that the hon Gentleman made yesterday , to the effect that semtex should be dumped for General de Chastelain to pick up ? Does the Minister accept that my right hon Friend the Member for Upper Bann ( Mr. Trimble ) has made endless concessions in an effort to get the IRA to live up to the obligations that it took upon itself last year , and that the Unionist people have nothing left to give ?

Is he further aware that the 24-hour rule for Members of Parliament , concerning the time in which they can make representations , is completely inadequate , and that until Tuesday of this week the immigration officers at Gatwick airport were unaware that they had to inform the United Kingdom immigrants advisory service of any refugee - seekers arriving in this country ?
